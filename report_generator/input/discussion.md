# Discussion Notes

## PCT Advantages
- **Interpretability**: Break down into control units
- **Biological plausibility**
- **Psychologically credible**
- **Smaller computational footprint**

## RL Advantages
- **Sample efficiency**
- **Generalization**
- **Scalability**

## Analysis Points
- **Comparative analysis**: Strengths and weaknesses of each approach
    - Furthermore, as PCT is not reliant on large datasets, as is RL, PCT, and its small footprint, is likely to result in superior scalability across diverse environments.
    - 
- **Trade-offs** between approaches
    - Based on this study RL does not provide any advantages over PCT.
- **Implications** for real-world applications
- **Limitations** of current study
    - The exploration of PCT in the Lunar Lander environment is still nascent, and further research is required to fully understand its capabilities and limitations. However, its hierarchical and modular nature suggests PCT is scalable to large and complex environments.
    - The PCT controller is not sensitivity to initial configurations.
- **Unexpected findings** and their explanations
