## INTRODUCTION
---------------

Introduction notes:
- Control systems critical for autonomous agents
- Traditional control vs modern AI approaches
- PCT offers biological inspiration and interpretability
- RL provides data-driven learning capabilities
- Research gap: direct comparison in standardized environment
- Specific environment provides consistent evaluation platform

================================================================================

## BACKGROUND
-------------

Background information to cover:
- Perceptual Control Theory fundamentals - elegant and powerful hierarchical architecure, 
self-correcting feedback loop, adapts to environment (Powers, 1973)
- Evolutionary algorithms for hierarchy optimization
- Reinforcement learning theory and deep Q-networks
- Environment characteristics and challenges
- Previous comparative studies limitations
- Control system evaluation metrics

================================================================================

## METHODOLOGY
--------------

Methodology details:
- Environment: Specify your target environment 
- PCT hierarchy: optimally generated by evolutionary algorithm, guided by rewards 
and specific fitness function. 
- Evolutionary algorithm: DEAP framework with Optuna hyperparameter optimization.
- RL approach: Simphony taken from OpenAI Gym leaderboard.
- Evaluation metrics: episodes, success of retries out of 100, steps, #nodes, #weights
- Statistical analysis: t-tests, effect sizes
- Hardware: spec of this machine
