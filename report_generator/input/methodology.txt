Methodology details:
- Environment: Specify your target environment 
- PCT hierarchy: optimally generated by evolutionary algorithm, guided by rewards and specific fitness function. 
- Evolutionary algorithm: DEAP framework with Optuna hyperparameter optimization.
- RL approach: Simphony taken from OpenAI Gym leaderboard.
- Evaluation metrics: episodes, success of retries out of 100, steps, #nodes, #weights
- Hardware: spec of this machine (CPU not GPU)
