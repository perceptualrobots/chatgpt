Results to present:

- Performance comparison across 100 episodes
- Video Young, R. (2025) shows random controller, RL (Symphony) controller and the evolved PCT controller.
- Image G:\My Drive\PR\reports\LunarLander\RLvPCT-toscale.png - shows the RL and PCT networks drawn to scale, with the PCT controller barely visible in comparison.
- Image G:\My Drive\PR\reports\LunarLander\PCT.png - the PCT network has just 1 level, with six control units. So, 6 perceptions simultaneously controlled, with their outputs combining to form the environment acions.


Summarise these results in a table:

- RL Result {"model_details": [{"name": "Actor", "total_parameters": 68610, "total_nodes": 514}, {"name": "Critic", "total_parameters": 267012, "total_nodes": 1284}], "total_parameters": 335622, "total_nodes": 1798, "num_episodes": 100, "count_100": 75, "count_neg100": 5, "count_near0": 20}
- PCT Result: {'model_details': {'total_nodes': 6, 'total_parameters': 29}, 'image_created': True, 'image_file': '/tmp/LunarLander_image.png', 'figure': <Figure size 800x800 with 1 Axes>, 'success': True}
