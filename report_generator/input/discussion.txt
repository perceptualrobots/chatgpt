Discussion points:
- PCT advantages: interpretability (break down into control units), biological plausibility, psychologically credible, smaller computational footprint
- RL advantages: sample efficiency, generalization, scalability
- Comparative analysis: strengths and weaknesses of each approach
- Trade-offs between approaches
- Implications for real-world applications
- Limitations of current study
- Unexpected findings and their explanations
