# Recommendations & Future Work Notes

## Recommendations

### Hybrid Approaches
- Based on this study there is advantage in combining **PCT and RL**.

### Extended Testing
- Testing on more **complex and realistic** world environments
- **Real-world robotics** applications

### Computational Optimization
- Implement **Evolutionary PCT in deep learning framework**
- **Parallel processing** and GPUs

### AI Interpretability
- **Human-interpretable AI systems**
- PCT control systems are inherently interpretable as each unit can be independently examined for what and how its inputs are being controlled.
