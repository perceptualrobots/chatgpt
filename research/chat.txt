Current Theories\n\nTheories of consciousness are numerous and varied; thus, a comprehensive review\n\nexceeds the current scope. Instead, presented here is a selection of the most prominent\n\ntheories.\n\n9.1. Information Processing Theories of Consciousness\n\nThe first three theories fall under the rubric of information processing approaches\n\n(IPToC), emphasizing the processing of information as central to conscious awareness.\n\nIntegrated Information Theory (IIT) (Tononi, 2017) is a high-profile example, though\n\nit has been criticized as an untestable pseudo-science (IIT-Concerned et al., 2023). IIT\n\nposits that a physical system must integrate a substantial amount of information to be\n\nconscious. According to IIT, consciousness arises when information is incorporated within\n\na subset of the physical system corresponding to a ‘maximum of irreducible integrated\n\ninformation.’ Essentially, this means that breaking down the experience into smaller\n\nparts results in a loss of conscious experience, as illustrated by the supposed necessity of\n\nintegrating constituent components to experience a visual scene as a whole.\n\nHigher-order theories (HOT) of consciousness (Carruthers, 2017), such as the Inner-\n\nSense Theory (Armstrong, 1968), argue that phenomenal consciousness involves higherorder\n\nmental representations of first-order sensory perceptions. These meta-representations\n\npropose that awareness derives from higher-order evaluations of first-order sensory inputs,\n\ndistinguishing conscious mental states from mere sensory inputs.\n\nGlobalWorkspace Theory (GWT) (Baars and Edelman, 2012) suggests that consciousness\n\nis akin to a global workspace where the contents of consciousness are synthesized\n\nfrom multiple non-conscious systems. This workspace facilitates a global overview of cognitive\n\nprocesses and mediates information, making it globally accessible. While the global\n\nworkspace is not identical to conscious experience, its global availability of information\n\nconstitutes consciousness.\n\n\n\n9.2. Additional Hypotheses\n\nBeyond IPToCs, several other hypotheses have been proposed. Hameroff and Penrose\n\n(1996) suggest that consciousness arises from quantum effects within neuronal microtubules,\n\nthough this lacks empirical support (Baars and Edelman, 2012). Crick and Koch\n\n(1990) propose that an attentional mechanism causing neurons to oscillate at 40-70 Hz\n\nactivates conscious short-term memory. Yet, they admit this theory is highly speculative\n\nand avoids addressing the subjective nature of consciousness.\n\nPanpsychism (Chalmers, 2017b; Goff, 2020) proposes that all matter possesses some\n\nform of protomentality. This theory broadens the scope of consciousness to include inanimate\n\nobjects, thereby bridging physicalism and dualism. Panqualityism (Mih´alik, 2020)\n\nextends this framework by suggesting that protoqualities, rather than mere protomentality,\n\nexist universally in matter.\n\nA contemporary PCT perspective (Mansell, 2024) also proposes that consciousness\n\nis related to the process of reorganization for adaptive modification of control systems\n\nto reduce intrinsic error. Similarly, the richness and diversity of conscious experience\n\nis derived from the complex perceptual functions at the multitude of layers within the\n\nhierarchy.\n\nMansell categorises three levels of consciousness : primary (basic sensory experiences),\n\nsecondary (integration and planning ) and tertiary (self-awareness). The focus of the\n\nperspective is on conflict within control systems at these levels. Consciousness is initially\n\nproposed to emerge at the primary level as the result of novel integration of lower level\n\ninput signals in situations of conflict. However, the impact of conflict within control\n\nsystems is an aspect of quality. So, CoPoQ can enhance this Integrative Control Theory\n\nperspective by providing a rationale for the conscious element of conflict (and other aspects\n\nof quality) as a perception of quality that can be controlled.\n\n9.3. Critique\n\nThe theories reviewed encounter several critical issues:\n\n1. Why should it lead to consciousness?\n\nIIT, HOT, and GWT hinge on complex information processing. However, they lack\n\na compelling explanation for why these additional processing stages would ignite\n\nconsciousness (Cleeremans and Jimenez, 2002; Dam´asio, 2021). This gap is especially\n\nevident in IIT’s suggestion that non-living systems could be conscious (Cerullo,\n\n2015). Conversely, the CoPoQ framework provides a unique view of consciousness\n\nwith quality characterizing a different dimension of experience representing the outcome\n\nof interaction with the environment rather than merely other or more complex\n\ninformational representations.\n\n2. Why should conscious states only be associated with complexity?\n\nWhile some conscious experiences may involve complex states, many do not. Simple,\n\nunitary sensations such as hunger or the feeling of a caress challenge the notion that\n\nconsciousness necessitates informational complexity. The CoPoQ approach accords\n\nconscious awareness at all levels of complexity.\n\n3. Why do conscious states transition to non-conscious states?\n\nAlthough current theories describe distinctions between conscious and unconscious\n\nstates (e.g. inside or outside the global workspace), they inadequately explain\n\nwhy formerly conscious states become unconscious, such as the detailed steps in\n\na complex dance routine. The CoPoQ perspective suggests that conscious states,\n\nassociated with perceptual quality during learning, dissolve upon achievement of\n\nproficiency and error reduction, making further consciousness unnecessary.\n\n4. What is meant by the term 'information'?\n\nThe concept of 'information' lacks consistency across theories, and its application in\n\na neural context is problematic. Prevailing criticisms highlight misapplications of information\n\ntheory (Nizami, 2019; Shannon, 1948), particularly in IIT, which presupposes\n\na priori conscious observers to evaluate content. Theories using 'information'\n\nmust clarify how neural activity gains meaning. Alternatively, the 'Double-Aspect'\n\ntheory of information (Chalmers, 2017b) suggests that the phenomenal aspect is\n\nintrinsic, thus making consciousness a precondition for information. As CoPoQ\n\nconcerns the transient, self-evaluation concept of quality it is not prone to the issues\n\nof the preeemince of consciousness or information.\n\n5. How does the theory explain qualia and valence we feel with consciousness?\n\nExisting theories often overlook or inadequately address the meaningful or valence\n\naspect of conscious experience. GWT, for instance, links valence with motivational\n\naspects but falls into a paradox where meaning requires consciousness, but consciousness\n\npresupposes meaning (Cochrane, 2023).\n\nPanpsychism and panqualityism imply pre-existent meaning, suggesting a predetermined\n\nnature that conflicts with the idea of emergent mental properties due to\n\nagent-environment interactions. Applied to natural selection, this line of thinking\n\nwould contravene the evolutionary emergence of physical attributes through speciesenvironment\n\nadaptation. Similarly, qualities perceived consciously arise from agentenvironment\n\ninteractions, and it is illogical to consider them pre-existing independently\n\nof such interactions.\n\nBy contrast, valence is an integral part of the concept of quality within CoPoQ.\n\n9.4. Predictive Processing\n\nAlthough Predictive processing (PP) is not a theory of consciousness per se, there\n\nare models that posit consciousness arising from prediction error optimization within a\n\nsensory-predictive framework (Cochrane, 2023). While PP addresses the dynamic interplay\n\nbetween high-level hypotheses and sensory inputs during phenomena like binocular\n\nrivalry, it also overlooks motivational valence, which is integral to conscious experience.\n\nCoPoQ accounts for dynamic fluctuations in a similar way, except that the interaction\n\nis between high-level goals and perceptual control error. Yet, CoPoQ also incorporates\n\nmotivational valence.\n\n9.5. Enactivism\n\nEnactivism, aligning with PCT, views agents as active and embodied, with meaningful\n\nstructures emerging from dynamic organism-environment interactions (Ward et al., 2017).\n\nHowever, PCT is differentiated from other enactivist-type theories by explicitly defining\n\nthat interaction as the control of perception. While enactivist theories, such as Ellis and\n\nNewton (2005), propose that consciousness arises from self-organizing systems imagining\n\ngoal-oriented actions, they fail to explain why consciousness is inevitable. On the other\n\nhand, PCT can be seen as an enactivist theory of behaviour and, applied to consciousness\n\n(CoPoQ), distinguishes itself as a higher-level explanation with the concept of quality\n\nbeing a meta or derivative level perception.\n\n\n\n9.6. Benefits of CoPoQ\n\nPanpsychism does not specify the necessary neural architecture for consciousness beyond\n\nrecognizing its importance. In contrast, CoPoQ, grounded in PCT, illustrates the\n\nprocesses and functional structures in the brain while explaining the distinction between\n\nconscious and non-conscious neural activity.\n\nConventional theories emphasize learning’s role in consciousness, often treating these\n\nas separate processes. CoPoQ uniquely asserts that consciousness and learning are intertwined;\n\nconsciousness occurs during explicit learning when an agent experiences and\n\nresolves perceptual errors, resulting in a return to a state of no error and the absence of\n\nconsciousness.\n\nBy integrating quality as a fundamental aspect of consciousness, CoPoQ offers a nuanced\n\nand holistic approach that addresses the limitations of existing theories while providing\n\na coherent explanation for conscious experience grounded in perceptual control and\n\nlearning processes."
